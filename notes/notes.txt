DATA SELECTION

get the ones that contain category cs in it
?maybe find some other threshold to not get all the papers, but it is fine, it is not that big tbf(journal_ref,scholar check using doi,get only if it has version 2)

!no further filtering leads to 32million lines(1.5gb), many of them have multiple fields like it is about physics but cs is also in the categories
!data is not ordered, at least not for dates 

DATA PROCESSING

EDA

sample before EDA(Full data length is 728065 meaning 728000 articles as javascript objects I think)(taking 9000 as sample For a 95% confidence level with a 1% margin of error)
while EDA, may use already listed categories since I've got that list, instead of tracking sample's categories
TODO use indexed dict instead of list

TODO make heatmap look better
✅ Keyword Trends Over Time
Find most tfidf words per year and compare years         
✅ Check for Duplicate Papers
Some papers may have multiple versions in versions[].
Decide whether to keep only the latest version (by sorting update_date).
✅ Find Missing Values
Count missing values in abstract, journal-ref, doi, etc.
If many papers are missing DOIs, consider ignoring that field.



?maybe don't do lda, just use metadata cs categories. if lda, look at title,abstract
?maybe do both and use lda to discover subcategories
